      <h1><em>History</em></h1>
    </div>
    <div class="history2">
      <p>Sacred Heart College came into existence on 21 January 1961 with Fr
        Thomas Mulligan (MHM) as the pioneer Principal.<br> Motivated by the need to
        cater for students from Bamenda who passed the entrance examination into
        <ins>Saint Joseph's<br> College</ins>, Sasse located hundreds of kilometres away, Fr
        Thomas Mulligan put together the first cohort of 30 boys at R.C.M Big<br>
        Mankon due to the lack of appropriate infrastructure. This single-sex
        boarding school which was officially inaugurated on<br> 8 July 1965 by His
        Excellency <ins>Augustine Ngom Jua</ins>, at the time Prime Minister of West
        Cameroon, later metamorphosed<br> into a full-fleshed secondary education
        institute in 1978 with the creation of a second Cycle. As at 2013, the
        student <br>enrolment stood at 880, with 52 teachers and 21 auxiliary staff.
        Apart from excelling in academics, Sacred Heart students are<br> well known for
        their sporting-intellectual talents and discipline.<br><br>
        Rev. Brother John Phillips summoned a meeting of the alumni on 2 May 1972,
        following the regrettable absence of ex-students<br> at the 10-year anniversary
        of SAHECO with the purpose of brainstorming on the establishment of an
        alumni association.<br> On June 12, the Sacred Heart Ex-Students Association
        (SHESA) was born and its first executive was formed with Mr Ebot Ntui<br> as the
        National President, and Mr. Ngwambe Fuh Gabriel as the Vice President.
        The principal mission of SHESA is promoting<br> the alma mater's teachings,
        which include academic excellence, fraternity, civil responsibility, service,
        god-fearing, and morally <br>upright attitude. To date, the Association has more
        Historythan ten chapters with some of them in the United States of America and<br>
        Europe. Ex-students of this institution are fondly called; SHESANS or Mishe.<br><br>
        SHESANS engage in different acts of charity in their various communities,
        as well as contribute towards assisting the development <br>and management of
        their alma-mater. On 18 September 2017, a dormitory got burned in what
        was suspected to be an arson attack<br> perpetrated by separatist fighters due
        to the ongoing <ins>Anglophone Crisis</ins>, prompting the mobilization of exstudents and<br>
         well-wishers who quickly raised funds for the reconstruction of
        the damaged building.<br><br>
        SHESA recently launched a <ins>microfinance institution</ins> called SHESA Credit
        Union with Head office in <ins>Yaoundé</ins>.</p>
